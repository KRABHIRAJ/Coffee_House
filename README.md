I have made a coffee shop application namely Coffee house. There is a list of coffee & coffee beans listed by the store and users can add products to cart. Users have the option of selecting size & weight of the product while adding to cart. User can also add products to Favourite List and then they can add required items to cart from favourite list. After adding required products to cart, Users can pay the amount through the dummy payment screen. After the order is placed, user can see all the order history by switching to OrderHistory Screen.
